# Welcome to the AsiaR community! ðŸ‘‹

R has been a very inclusive community and collective learning has always helped, with many users of R in Asian countries we can as well have a strongly knit community for Râ€™s users. Inspired by the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) R, AfricaR, and LatinR user groups, we proposed a similar incubator to connect and strengthen the R community in Asia during useR! 2021 global conference. 

AsiaR is an initiative to promote R communities in countries across Asia (India, Japan, Nepal, S. Korea, Singapore, and Pakistan) within the context of the challenges and constraints posed by the cultures and economies. Our goal is to build a diverse and vibrant R community within Asia. We aim to target participants who are active R users and/or learners who have not been engaged with any R community and we want to invite successful R developers/educators/community leaders in various Asian countries. We wish to connect Asian useRs to each other, identify Asian R speakers/participants, and facilitate regular webinars, workshops. Everyone is welcome to join AsiaR meetups, and participants must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AsiaR-community/coc).

## Goals

- To build a diverse and vibrant R community within Asia
- Connect Asian useRs to each other
- Identify Asian R speakers/participants and facilitate regular webinars, workshops
- Build a strong enough community to host an AsiaR conference in 2023
- Discuss and learn about best practices for nucleating and sustaining an engaged community. Specifically, address the lower participation of Asians, specifically Asian URMs in local meetups and international conferences like useR!, rstudio::conference, R@IISA etc,. 
- Engage with people from various backgrounds and organisations to understand how they lean on the community for assistance.
